# AP News Scraper
---
A personal project, this utility fetches a handful of Associated Press stories from a range of available categories.

Categories so far include:
- U.S.
- World
- Politics
- Business
- Science
- Entertainment
- Religion

## Goals with this project
---
To better familiarize myself with React and Node.js web scraping using the Cheerio module for HTML parsing.

## Front-end
---
The front-end is built with React, and incorporates the react-router-dom module for basic routing functions. Styles are written in SCSS.

## Todos
---
[] Implement implement placeholder cards while fetching news listings
[] Update nav bar to include a back arrow
[] Create hamburger menu
[] Remove hamburger for laptops and above

## Disclaimer

This app serves no purpose other than to showcase, and harden, my front- and back-end development skills. I will make **no profit** off this application. All stories I fetch from Associated Press are reduced to the first three paragraphs, after which a button redirects users to the official Associated Press article.
